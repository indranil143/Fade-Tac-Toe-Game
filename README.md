# 🕹️ FadeTacToe - A Stylish Tic Tac Toe Game with Sound Effects and Disappearing Moves

FadeTacToe is a visually enhanced version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python and Pygame. It introduces a fun mechanic: each player can have only **3 visible moves** on the board at a time. As new moves are made, older ones **fade** and then **disappear**, adding a dynamic visual twist to the strategy. Simple to play yet exciting, with sound effects, winner detection, and a smooth UI.
